Thanks for contributing! A few quick guidelines to keep contributions smooth.

- **Issues**: Open clear, minimal issues with steps to reproduce and expected behavior.
- **PRs**: Keep changes focused. Add tests where applicable and reference the issue number.
- **Code style**: Follow existing patterns in the repo. Use meaningful commit messages.
- **Automations**: CI runs on push; expected checks must pass before merging.

If you want a custom contribution workflow (labels, templates, or bots), tell me and I'll scaffold it.
